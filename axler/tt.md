THE UNREALITY OF TIME - J. ELLIS MCTAGGA

"In philosophy, again, time is treatedas unrealby Spinoza,by Kant,by Hegel and by Schopenhauer"

"universe in which nothing whatever changed (including the thoughts of the conscious beings in it) would be a timeless universe"

"all change is only a change of the characteristics imparted to events by their presencein the A series, whether those characteristics are qualities or relation"

 - earlier and later positions and past, present, and future positions. The former distinctions are permanent, while the latter distinctions are not
 - past, present, and future may be regarded as more fundamental than the earlier and later distinctions

 - The A and B series are both essential to time.
 - The A series is ultimate, and we cannot explain past, present, and future in a definitional way.
 - The B series is not ultimate and is dependent on a C series of permanent relations of terms.
 - The terms of the C series form an A series, which results in a B series, with the earlier terms being placed first in the direction from past to future.

 - The difficulty of explaining the distinction between past, present, and future is related to the fact that there is no verb-form common to all three.
 - The answer to the difficulty involves explaining that moments have characteristics of past, present, and future successively, but this explanation is circular because it presupposes the existence of time to account for the A series, while the A series has to be assumed to account for time.
 - This circularity creates a problem in explaining the nature of time and the distinction between past, present, and future, making it challenging to provide a coherent account of time.

 - Denial of reality of time is not paradoxical
 - Experience of time is illusory, regardless of time being real or unreal
 - The specious present cannot correspond to the present of the events observed
 - Past and future of observations cannot correspond to the past and future of events observed
 - Conclusion: neither time as a whole nor A and B series exist, but the C series might exist
 - The C series may represent non-temporal realities
 - It is possible that the events perceived as a time-series do form a C series, making it the more probable view.

"If this view is adopted, the result will so farresemblethose reached by Hegel ratherthan those of Kant. For Hegel regarded the order of the time-series as a reflexion,though a distorted reflexion,of something in the real nature of the timeless reality, while Kant
does not seem to have contemplated the possibility that 'anything in the nature of the noumenon should correspond to the time order which appears in the phenomenon"

Four Dimensionalism - Theodore Sider

 - primitive notions of fourth-dimensionalism: the mereological notion of a part at a time, and the spatiotemporal notion of existing at a time.
 - Four-dimensionalists tend to speak of the parts of an object simpliciter, rather than the parts it has at this time or that.
 - Four-dimensionalists use an atemporal notion of exemplification of properties and relations.
 - Four-dimensionalists accept the notion of change as a difference between successive temporal parts.
 - Change occurs in relations and mereology as well.

temporal parthood: P@T) Necessarily, x is part of y at t iff x and y each exist at t, and x’s temporal part at t is part of y’s temporal part at t

"As with temporary parthood, there is a principle governing existence-at that is accepted by the four dimensionalist but not by the three dimensionalist: an object exists at a time iff it has a temporal part that exists at that time."

Thesis of Temporal Locality: Necessarily, for any object $\mathrm{x}$, and for any non-empty, non-overlapping sets of times $T_1$ and $T_2$ whose union is the time span of $x$, there are two objects $\mathrm{x}_1$ and $\mathrm{x}_2$, such that i) $\mathrm{x}_1$ and $\mathrm{x}$ have the same parts at every time in $T_1$, ii) $x_2$ and $x$ have the same parts at every time in $T_2$, and iii) the time span of $x_1=T_1$, while the time span of $x_2=T_2$

$\mathrm{x}$ is an instantaneous temporal part of $\mathrm{y}$ at instant $\mathrm{t}={ }_{d f}$ i) $\mathrm{x}$ exists at, but only at $t$, ii) $\mathrm{x}$ is part of $\mathrm{y}$ at $t$, and iii) $\mathrm{x}$ overlaps at $t$ everything that is part of $\mathrm{y}$ at $\mathrm{t}$

 - three dimensionalists reject the Thesis of Temporal Locality, together with its implication that all objects must have temporal parts

Argument premises:
