THE UNREALITY OF TIME - J. ELLIS MCTAGGA

"In philosophy, again, time is treatedas unrealby Spinoza,by Kant,by Hegel and by Schopenhauer"

"universe in which nothing whatever changed (including the thoughts of the conscious beings in it) would be a timeless universe"

"all change is only a change of the characteristics imparted to events by their presencein the A series, whether those characteristics are qualities or relation"

 - earlier and later positions and past, present, and future positions. The former distinctions are permanent, while the latter distinctions are not
 - past, present, and future may be regarded as more fundamental than the earlier and later distinctions
