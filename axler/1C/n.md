1.32 Definition subspace

A subset $U$ of $V$ is called a subspace of $V$ if $U$ is also a vector space (using the same addition and scalar multiplication as on $V$ ).

1.34 Conditions for a subspace

A subset $U$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if $U$ satisfies the following three conditions:
additive identity
$$
0 \in U
$$
closed under addition
$$
u, w \in U \text { implies } u+w \in U \text {; }
$$
closed under scalar multiplication
$a \in \mathbf{F}$ and $u \in U$ implies $a u \in U$.

1.36 Definition sum of subsets

Suppose $U_1, \ldots, U_m$ are subsets of $V$. The sum of $U_1, \ldots, U_m$, denoted $U_1+\cdots+U_m$, is the set of all possible sums of elements of $U_1, \ldots, U_m$. More precisely,
$$
U_1+\cdots+U_m=\left\{u_1+\cdots+u_m: u_1 \in U_1, \ldots, u_m \in U_m\right\}
$$

1.39 Sum of subspaces is the smallest containing subspace Suppose $U_1, \ldots, U_m$ are subspaces of $V$. Then $U_1+\cdots+U_m$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ containing $U_1, \ldots, U_m$.

1.40 Definition direct sum

Suppose $U_1, \ldots, U_m$ are subspaces of $V$.
- The sum $U_1+\cdots+U_m$ is called a direct sum if each element of $U_1+\cdots+U_m$ can be written in only one way as a sum $u_1+\cdots+u_m$, where each $u_j$ is in $U_j$.
- If $U_1+\cdots+U_m$ is a direct sum, then $U_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus U_m$ denotes $U_1+\cdots+U_m$, with the $\oplus$ notation serving as an indication that this is a direct sum.
